##### Title:
Operation RPG (Subject to Change)

##### Description:
A real-time multiplayer role playing game (MMORPG), with basic game mechanics.


##### Vision Statement:
This is a fun and innovative game that provides entertainment. You can play by your self or with a friend, for now we are trying to 
make teh game PVE oriented. Maybe later in development, we'll think of adding PVP

##### Motivation:
We would like to learn about game development and gain experience creating something through teamwork. 

##### Risks:
- group members may be unfamiliar with involved technologies
- there may be difficulty in connecting multiple technologies over network connections
- providing cross-platform or support for legacy browers may consume large amounts of time

##### Mitigation Strategy:
- If group members are unfamiliar with involved technologies, they will try their best to learn more about the technology.
- Starting early on the project and pacing the timing will mitigate the last two risks in the project.
